# README

## Context
This is the result of a task from my course "GIS and Webmapping".

## Task
- create a WMS of restaurants in Berlin on GeoServer (this step was done separately)
- creat a website loading the WMS via OpenLayers
- let the user add points to the database by clicking on the location in the map (storing the coordinates) and writing a name and type of food.

## Further information
Note: You need a GeoServer and a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database to run the code
