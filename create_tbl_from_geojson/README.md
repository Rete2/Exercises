## Context
This is the result of a task from my class "GIS and Webmapping" course.

## Task
* Save the the geojson 'cities' as a JavaScript file and create a table showing the FID, the city name, the country and  the Population.
* Add a star to each city that is in Europe.
* Add a list of all the continents and add the number of cities for each continent in form of a badge.

## Further instructions
For display of the html file, you need to store the file iteration.js and cities.js in the same folder.
